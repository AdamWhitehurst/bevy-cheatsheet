## Contribution guidelines

Contributions to improve the cheatsheet are always welcome.

Keep everything self-contained in one document. It shall not be fragmented.

 - Large, clear headings, to visually search the document easily.
 - Focus on brevity.
 - Prefer showing multiple features concisely in a single example, when not confusing.
 - Present advanced ways of using a feature separately from the basics, to avoid having an overwhelming amount of information in one section.
 - Avoid repeating information found elsewhere in the document.
 - Prefer short and clear sentences.
 - Explanations should be no more than a few sentences. Cover the most important points.
 - Point out caveats and relevant practical workarounds.
 - Keep examples minimalistic. Only show the syntax for the feature. Larger examples should instead be contributed to Bevy proper.
 - Try to keep a logical order to the document. Ideally, the topics needed to understand a section should come before it.
 - Avoid long lines of code, to keep it readable on small screens.
 - Be civil. If you need a code of conduct, have a look at Bevy's.
